What Is This?
-------------

This Web Page is intended to provide working tasks for a Sales Management Web Application.  
The Web Page strive to be simple, well documented and modification friendly, in order
to help evaluators quickly look to my work.

These tasks are meant to show you about my code-level development for front-end web design.
The templates used are: "novus admin panel web" (https://w3layouts.com/novus-admin-panel-flat-bootstrap-responsive-web-template/) and "ideal_theme_login_form-web" (https://w3layouts.com/ideal-theme-login-form-responsive-widget-template).
Both were downloaded from https://w3layouts.com/
